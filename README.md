# Rohr Engine

Rohr Engine is a small 2D game engine written in C with SDL3.

This project grew out of a passion for systems development, which gradually led me toward exploring engine design. It is a hands-on side project where I can experiment with low-level concepts, build each component from the ground up, and refine the design as it develops.

The aim is not to compete with large, established engines. Instead, the goal is to create a small, approachable, and hackable C engine whose core systems remain visible, understandable, and useful for experimentation.

Pull requests are welcome. Contributions such as new features, improved examples, bug fixes, documentation updates, and suggestions for cleaner design or structure are all appreciated.

## What It Does

Rohr Engine currently focuses on data-oriented 2D simulation:

* Entity ids are stable handles, separate from table indices.
* Component data is stored in indexed tables for cache-friendly systems.
* Object pools back engine tables and grow as entities are added.
* Entity table indices are still preserved for compute-heavy loops.
* Systems use explicit component masks instead of hidden object behavior.
* Physics supports convex polygon and circle-style shape data.
* Collision uses SAT for convex polygon overlap checks.
* Rigid bodies support mass, velocity, acceleration, angular velocity, restitution, and friction.
* Constraints include joints, axis locks, angle locks, and transform locks.
* Sprite animation is driven through SDL3 textures.
* Screen recording can write MP4 output through ffmpeg.
* A terminal console exists for engine logs and debugging.
* Doxygen comments are used for API documentation.

The engine is still early and in development so your mileage may vary.
I look forward to releasing a game with Rohr Engine in the soon future.

## Public API

Application code should include the public Rohr API facade:

```c
#include "rohr.h"
```

The public layer uses `rohr_` prefixes, for example:

```c
rohr_console_init();

EngineResult result = rohr_engine_init();
if(rohr_error_check(result)) {
    rohr_console_write(LOG_ENGINE, rohr_error_default_message(result.result.error));
    return 1;
}

EntityResult entity_result = rohr_entity_add();
if(rohr_error_check(entity_result)) {
    rohr_console_write(LOG_ENGINE, rohr_error_default_message(entity_result.result.error));
    return 1;
}
```

Internal modules still exist under `include/` and `src/`, but examples are intended to use the public API where possible.

├── src/                   # Engine implementation and private headers
├── docs/                  # Doxygen config and documentation source
├── docs/assets/           # README and documentation media
├── examples/              # Example programs and example assets
├── lib/                   # Generated static library output
└── build/                 # Generated objects, binaries, and docs
```

## Building

### Dependencies

* C compiler: `clang` or `gcc`
* C standard library
* `make`
* `pkg-config`
* `sdl3`
* `sdl3-image`
* `ncurses`
* `ffmpeg` for recording or converting demo media
* Math library: `libm` / `-lm`

Build the engine and examples:

```sh
make build
```

Run the pit example:

```sh
make run-pit
```

Run the ball example:

```sh
make run-ball
```

Run the viewport example:

```sh
make run-view
```

## Nix

If you use Nix, the development shell includes the C toolchain, SDL dependencies, ffmpeg, and Doxygen:

```sh
nix develop
```

Then build normally:

```sh
make build
```

## Documentation

Readable Markdown docs are committed in the repo:

* [Public API reference](docs/public_api.md)
* [Documentation overview](docs/README.md)
* [Architecture notes](docs/architecture.md)
* [Entity ids](docs/entity_ids.md)
* [Error handling](docs/errors.md)

Generate the Doxygen docs with:

```sh
make docs
```

The generated HTML is written to:

```text
build/docs/html/index.html
```

Documentation source lives in `docs/`, and API comments live mainly in `include/`. Generated HTML under `build/docs/` is not committed.

For a movable standalone README preview, run:

```sh
make static-readme
```

That writes `build/static/readme.html` and stages linked video assets under
`build/static/docs/assets/`.

## Examples

Current examples:

* `flies-in-pit`: physics, particles, animated sprites, collisions, grid drawing, and recording.
* `flies-around-ball`: joints, attraction-style motion, particles, and animated sprites.
* `view-port`: basic sprite movement and input handling.

Build output goes to:

```text
build/examples/
```

## Contributing

This project is very open to pull requests.

Useful contributions include:

* Bug fixes
* More examples
* Better docs
* Safer public API wrappers
* Physics fixes or focused improvements
* Rendering improvements
* Input, audio, camera, UI, or scene features
* Tests or reproducible demo cases
* Cleanup that keeps the engine simple and explicit

Please keep the style of the project in mind: plain C, explicit ownership, minimal dependencies, and focused changes.

## License Intent

I want Rohr Engine to be usable as a library in other projects, including closed-source games or applications, while still requiring changes to the engine itself to stay open when distributed.

That sounds closest to the GNU Lesser General Public License, likely `LGPL-3.0-or-later`, but the license is not finalized until the repository includes the proper license files. If you plan to use this seriously before that is finished, please check the current repo state first.

The intent is:

* You can link the engine as a library from your own project.
* Your game or application code can remain under your own license.
* If you modify and distribute the engine itself, those engine changes should be shared under the same library license.

## Roadmap

Things I would like to keep improving:

* Stable public API coverage
* Better camera and viewport tools
* Audio
* Scene serialization
* More complete input system
* More rendering helpers
* UI framework
* Better examples
* Tests and validation tools
* More complete documentation

Rohr Engine is an active personal project. It is rough in places, but the goal is to keep improving it in the open and make the engine easier to use, inspect, and contribute to over time.
